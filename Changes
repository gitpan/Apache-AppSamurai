Revision history for Apache-AppSamurai

1.01	2008-05-03
        * REQUIRED CHANGE - The new login form signature check (described
          below) require changes to login.pl and login.html.  It is
          recommended that you replace your existing login.pl with
          examples/htdocs/login.pl.  To preserve your customizations
          to login.html, it is recommended that you add in changes manually.
          For most cases, you should be able to add lines right after:

            <input type="hidden" name="destination" value="__URI__" />

          to support the changes.  Add the following to your login.html:

            <input type="hidden" name="nonce" value="__NONCE__" />
            <input type="hidden" name="sig" value="__SIG__" />

        * Added nonce and signature to login.pl login form and checking
          in Apache::AppSamurai::login().  All form logins must now provide
          a valid nonce and signature.  This is a Cross Site Request Forgery
          style protection, but since the user is not yet logged in, does
          not ACTUALLY provide CSRF protection.  Instead, it is a additional
          bar to raise and prevent some types of scripted brute force/DoS
          attempts.

        * Added AuthSimple.pm, a authentication module for the
          Authen::Simple authentication framework, which supports
          numerous authentication methods (Kerberos, LDAP, PAM, etc.)

	* Changed Build.PL to attempt to pre-detect mod_perl version
          installed, adding requirement for mod_perl 2 if nothing is
          found

        * Changed Build.PL to attempt to pre-detect cipher module
          for use with Crypt::CBC, adding requirement for
          Crypt::Rijndael if none are found

        * Added "use warnings" to all modules

	* Added Pod test (Pod Coverage test left disabled until more methods
          are documented or set to ignore)
 
1.00	2007-10-01
	First release with Apache 2.x/mod_perl 2.x support.  Changes
	include:
	
	* Unified Apache 1.x/mod_perl 1.x and Apache 2.x/mod_perl 2.x
	  support (adds requirement for libapreq)

	* mod_perl 1.x/mod_perl 2.x examples in Apache::AppSamurai
	  documentation and a unified example in examples/conf/

	* Crypt::CBC used for session data encryption with support for
	  for Crypt::Rijndael, Crypt::OpenSSL::AES, Crypt::Twofish, or
	  Crypt::Blowfish as the backend block cipher module.

	* Added SessionSerializeCipher option to specify the block cipher
	  module to use.  (If undefined, Apache::AppSamurai attempts to
	  auto-detect a suitable module.)

	* Ships with ExtUtils::MakeMaker Makefile.PL for users without
	  Module::Build. (Module::Build install is still preferred)

	* All submodules now use their CVS revision for their VERSION.

	* Added LoginDestination and LogoutDestination options to
	  define specific URIs to send users to after login/logout

	* Added confconfer.pl script (under examples/conf) for easier
	  configuration based on template examples in examples/conf

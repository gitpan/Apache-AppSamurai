AppSamurai TODO
---------------
* doc - Howto? FAQ?
* doc - Add method documentation to modules.  (Missing on many, including
        "alterlist" related methods.)

* feature - Add tracked nonce check to login.pl to identify attempted re-posts
* feature - Add "last access" tracker and complementary stale session data
            cleaner.  (Could use for in-prog audit trail, too, just don't log
            anything sensitive)
* feature - Add more auth modules (volunteers?)  Potential candidates:
        = Web form - Use LWP::UserAgent to attempt login to a form login based
                     web page
        = LDAP - Using Net::LDAP?
        = Kerberos5 - Using Authen::Krb5Password?
        = TACACS+ - Using Net::TacacsPlus?
        = PAM - Using Authen::PAM?
        = CAPTCHA - Using Authen::PluggableCaptcha or Authen::Captcha?
        = OpenID - Using Net::OpenID::Consumer?
        = Lots of others - Authen::Simple::* modules and/or other mutli-auth
                           frameworks
* feature - Add multi-stage login support (for challenge/response, next
            tokencode mode, NTLM/Kerberos integrated  IE auth, etc.)
* feature - CheckUrl is weak and more extensive URL/header sanity filtering
            is needed
* feature - Logout is crude and blocks application's native logout.  Add a
            capture system to send logout request to backend, then bundle into
            session kill and send back to browser.
* feature - Add alterlist configuration options (for Apache config)
* feature - Should refactor the Session, Tracker, and AlterList into individual
            modules.  AppSamurai.pm is WAY too fat a pig.
* feature - Modularize/generalize the Tracker feature to be like Auth system.
* feature - Add a tracker based filter for dynamic rule based filtering, and
            a small Perl tool to modify the tracker externally.  Example use:
            Blocking a specific Windows Mobile device ID.

* uber-feature - Filter server responses. (Would require skipping mod_proxy
                 in Apache 1.x and doing a direct fetch)

* mothballed - RequestFilter feature - Not used, not well tested, and much
               better options exists (mod_security anyone?)

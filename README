Apache-AppSamurai - README
--------------------------

This is a system to protect vulnerable or sensitive web applications.
The target use is in reverse proxy configurations, with a Apache mod_perl
proxy inside a DMZ and a backend web server in another DMZ or an internal
network.

Apache::AppSamurai features:
* Extensible/modular multi-factor authentication
* Form based or Basic auth based authentication on frontend
* Encrypted storage of session data on proxy
* "Alterlist" system to add/change/delete cookies or headers before
  passing requests to the backend
* Able to use any Apache::Session Storage type (including MySQL or Postgress
  for clustered deployment)
* Completely configurable from httpd.conf
* Lots of other stuff

Apache 1.3.x and mod_perl 1.x are currently supported.

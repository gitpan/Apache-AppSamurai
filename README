Apache-AppSamurai - README
--------------------------

This is a system to protect vulnerable or sensitive web applications.
The target use is in reverse proxy configurations, with a Apache mod_perl
proxy inside a DMZ and a backend web server in another DMZ or an internal
network.

Apache::AppSamurai features:
* Extensible/modular multi-factor authentication
* Form based or Basic auth based authentication on frontend
* Encrypted storage of session data on proxy
* Able to use any Apache::Session Storage type (including MySQL or Postgress
  for clustered deployment)
* Completely configurable from httpd.conf
* Supports Apache 1.x/mod_perl 1.x and Apache 2.x/mod_perl 2.x with minimal
  configuration file differences.
* Lots of other stuff


INSTALLATION

- With Module::Build (suggested)

Module::Build is suggested to install this package, and is available
from CPAN, or as a package for many systems.
(Skip to the next subsection if you prefer to use a traditional
ExtUtils::MakeMaker Makefile.PL.)

To install this module with Module::Build, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

If you would like to install the tools and example files, you can run
Build install and define an installation path for "misc":

   ./Build install --install_path misc=/usr/local/share/AppSamurai


- With ExtUtils::MakeMaker

A simple Makefile.PL file is also provided, and should provide enough
installation functionality for most users.  (Note - This method does
not install examples, tools, or detect optional modules at this time.)

To install with Makefile.PL:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
